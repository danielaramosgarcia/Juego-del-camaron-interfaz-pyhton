# Juego-del-camaron-interfaz-pyhton
"Shrimp game" made in python with Turtle library for user interface. This project is part of the final assingment of TC1033 (object oriented programming) from first semester of computer engineer.
The first screen that is displayed asks for the users name to later use it in the intructions and congratulation label, this first screen draws the letters that are pressed on the keyboard for visual aid. The next screen is a 3 bottom menu with the options of intructions, which displays the instructions of the game and lets you get back to the menu, the option of game, which displays the board where the users will play using the keyboard arrows and also allows the user to get back the menu, and finally the third option ends the execution of the program.
